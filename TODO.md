# TODO

* Make it easier to use as 3rd party lib
* Add keybindings (ctrl l, ctrl p, ctrl n, ctrl o, ctrl a, ctrl e)
* Add Plugin system
* Add window frame
* Allow visual customization

# DONE

* Improve prompt, stop adding it on the command itself, this is causing needless complexity
* Pass arguments to commands
